# Strike Three

Strike three is a very simple site for a very simple need: to unwind, relax and play a fun game with a friend. The goal of the game is to get three in a row before your opponent does. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The game also comes accompanied by a nice relaxing background and some fun sounds, and you can always restart the game at any time with the handy "Restart button". Whenever one player manages to get three in a row the game will let the players know by striking a line through the winning cells and proclaim either "X" or "O" as the winner.
